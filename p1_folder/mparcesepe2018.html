<h2 style="font-size:30px;">Hello! This a little webpage about the stuff I enjoy outside of work and school. </h2>
    
<h3 style="font-size:20px;">Basic Info:</h3>
    
    <p1 style = "color: white">Although I currently live in Florida and attend  <span style ="color: blue;">Florida Atlantic University</span>, I was originally born in Connecticut and lived there for the first 12 years of my life. I grew up in a pretty small town called Middletown and lived a pretty quiet life. When I was 13 years old I moved to Florida where I attended Boca Raton Community High School. I was on the debate team and competed in mock congress learning how to public speak. During this time a started to foster a passion for Formula One. </p1>

<h4 style="font-size:20px;">Formula One and the Art of Driving:</h4>
    
    <p2 style = "color: white">As a kid I was always fascinated by the automobile. Particulary I wanted to get behind the wheel of something. Although I was timid, a passion for going fast was always in my blood. Playing games such as "Gran Turismo" really began what I loved most about cars: racing.</p2>

    <p3 style = "color: white">Fast forward to when I was in high school, I started to revive my passion for racing through Formula One. I began to obsessivley pour over information on some of the greatest drivers of all time such as Senna, Schumacher, and Fangio. What was truly most facinating to me, as I began to learn more, was how mysterious these figures seemed. At the time I was getting into all of this, not many people understood the magic that came along with this sport. But, with the help of Netflix's "Drive to Survive" and the purchase of the sport by Liberty Media, Formula One has become a massive sport adored by fans of all kinds in all different kinds of places.</p3>
